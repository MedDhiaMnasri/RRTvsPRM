# RRTvsPRM
A probabilistic roadmap (PRM) is a network graph of possible paths in a given map based on free and occupied spaces. The mobileRobotPRM object randomly generates nodes and creates connections between these nodes based on the PRM algorithm parameters. Nodes are connected based on the obstacle locations specified in Map, and on the specified ConnectionDistance. You can customize the number of nodes, NumNodes, to fit the complexity of the map and the desire to find the most efficient path. The PRM algorithm uses the network of connected nodes to find an obstacle-free path from a start to an end location. To plan a path through an environment effectively, tune the NumNodes and ConnectionDistance properties.
When creating or updating the mobileRobotPRM class, the node locations are randomly generated, which can affect your final path between multiple iterations. This selection of nodes occurs when you specify Map initially, change the parameters, or update is called. To get consistent results with the same node placement, use rng to save the state of the random number generation. See Tune the Connection Distance for an example using rng.

RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree) is a path planning algorithm used in robotics to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The algorithm starts by randomly generating points in the environment and incrementally builds a tree by connecting these points to the nearest existing node in the tree, moving towards them in small steps. This tree grows rapidly towards unexplored regions, hence the name. The process continues until a path from the start point to the goal is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached. RRT is particularly effective in complex environments with obstacles, as it can find a feasible path even in spaces with many constraints, though it may not always find the optimal path.
